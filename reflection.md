Reflection Questions

1. What accessibility enhancements were the most challenging to implement, and why?
   I found that the contrast colors were the most challenging to implement, because you have to perform several steps to find the contrast itself and then need to experiement with changing color values and/or altering background images to make the contrast better. Most other accessiblity changes are fairly simple text changes in the HTML/CSS, which don't involve a trial and error approach.

2. How do ARIA attributes improve the experience for users relying on assistive technologies?
   ARIA attributes allow screen readers and other technology to better interpret a page, providing better feedback to users with assistive tech helping them to use your websites more effectively.

3. What tools did you use to check color contrast, and how did they help?
   I used the WebAIM contrast checker to manually compare color values along with the Chrome dev tools styles color picker. These tools helped by showing contrast values along with the AA/AAA scores, so that I could know when the colors would be acceptable.
